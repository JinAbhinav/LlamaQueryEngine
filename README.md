# LlamaQuery Engine 🚀  

LlamaQuery Engine is an intelligent NLP-powered system that transforms natural language queries into structured dataset prompts using Llama’s advanced LLM capabilities. This project streamlines data retrieval by leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques, optimizing query generation for high accuracy and efficiency.

## 🔥 Features
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Converts human-like queries into structured prompts with high precision.
- **AI-Powered Query Optimization:** Utilizes Llama’s LLM capabilities to enhance performance and accuracy.
- **Scalable & Cloud-Ready:** Designed for deployment on cloud platforms like Amazon Azure.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Easily customizable for different applications and integrations.
- **Enterprise-Grade Performance:** Developed in collaboration with **TCS** for real-world scalability.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **User Input:** The user enters a natural language query (e.g., *“Show me all active users from the last month.”*).
2. **NLP Processing:** Llama processes the input using advanced language models to extract intent and key parameters.
3. **Prompt Generation:** The system dynamically constructs an optimized dataset prompt based on extracted parameters.
4. **Output:** The structured prompt is ready to be used for querying datasets efficiently.
